      "name": "Predictive Maintenance Advisor",
      "overview": "The Predictive Maintenance Advisor is an AI-powered service designed to analyze telematics data from commercial vehicles to forecast maintenance needs. By leveraging machine learning algorithms, the service identifies potential component failures before they occur, enabling proactive maintenance scheduling. This prevents unexpected breakdowns, minimizes downtime, reduces repair costs, and extends the lifespan of vehicles. The system integrates seamlessly with existing telematics systems and provides actionable insights through a user-friendly dashboard and API, empowering fleet managers and maintenance personnel to make data-driven decisions. The advisor goes beyond simple threshold-based alerts by considering complex patterns and correlations within the data to provide accurate and timely maintenance recommendations.",

      "core_features": [
        "Real-Time Data Analysis: Continuously monitors telematics data streams from vehicle sensors, including engine temperature, oil pressure, mileage, fuel consumption, and diagnostic trouble codes (DTCs).",
        "Predictive Modeling: Employs machine learning models to forecast the remaining useful life (RUL) of critical vehicle components, such as engines, transmissions, brakes, tires, and turbochargers. These models are trained on historical data and continuously refined with new information.",
        "Alerting and Notifications: Generates proactive alerts and notifications when a potential component failure is detected, providing sufficient lead time for scheduling maintenance. Alerts are customizable and can be delivered via email, SMS, or through the integrated dashboard.",
        "Maintenance Recommendations: Provides specific maintenance recommendations based on the predicted failure mode, including suggested repairs, parts replacements, and estimated labor costs. These recommendations are tailored to the specific vehicle model and operating conditions.",
        "Reporting and Analytics: Offers comprehensive reporting and analytics dashboards that visualize vehicle health trends, maintenance costs, and downtime metrics. Users can generate custom reports to track key performance indicators (KPIs) and identify areas for improvement."
      ],
      "user_journeys": [
        "A fleet manager logs into the Predictive Maintenance Advisor dashboard. They see a list of vehicles sorted by predicted maintenance needs. They click on a specific truck and see that the system predicts a turbocharger failure within the next 1,000 miles. The system recommends replacing the turbocharger and provides an estimated cost. The fleet manager schedules the repair during a planned downtime, avoiding a potential breakdown on the road. They update the system with the repair details, which are then used to refine the predictive models."

      "ai_capabilities": [
        "Time Series Forecasting: Uses LSTM or Transformer models to predict the future values of sensor data based on historical trends. This is used to identify anomalies and forecast component degradation.",

        "Remaining Useful Life (RUL) Prediction: Uses regression models (e.g., Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) to estimate the remaining lifespan of critical components based on sensor data and historical failure data. Feature engineering is crucial, deriving features like rolling averages, standard deviations, and derivatives from sensor readings.",
