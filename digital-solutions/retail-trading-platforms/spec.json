        "Trading Pattern Analysis – Machine learning algorithms analyze historical trading data to identify patterns, biases, and weaknesses in a trader's approach. This includes win/loss ratios, holding periods, asset allocation, and trading frequency. Specific patterns like consistently buying high or selling low are flagged.",
        "Personalized Recommendations – Based on the trading pattern analysis, the system provides personalized recommendations for improving strategy and risk management. These recommendations can include suggested trading strategies, risk parameter adjustments, and educational content tailored to the trader's specific needs and weaknesses. For example, if a trader consistently holds losing positions for too long, the system might recommend setting stop-loss orders or taking profits earlier.",
        "Risk Tolerance Assessment – A questionnaire and behavioral analysis assess the trader's risk tolerance and investment goals. This information is used to tailor the recommendations and ensure they align with the trader's individual circumstances. The system dynamically adjusts the risk assessment based on the trader's performance and market conditions.",
        "Chatbot Interface – A user-friendly chatbot interface provides real-time support, answers questions, and delivers personalized advice. The chatbot can also provide educational content, such as articles, videos, and tutorials, on specific trading topics. The chatbot is designed to be interactive and engaging, encouraging traders to ask questions and learn from the system.",
        "Performance Tracking and Reporting – The system tracks user progress and provides regular reports on key performance metrics, such as win/loss ratio, average profit per trade, and risk-adjusted return. These reports help traders monitor their performance, identify areas for improvement, and track the effectiveness of the system's recommendations."

      "ai_capabilities": [
        "Machine Learning: Uses supervised learning (e.g., XGBoost, Random Forest) to classify trading patterns as 'successful' or 'unsuccessful' based on historical data and market conditions. Models are trained to predict the probability of success for different trading strategies given a trader's profile and current market conditions.",
        "Natural Language Processing (NLP): Employs NLP to understand user queries in the chatbot and generate personalized responses. This includes sentiment analysis to gauge the user's emotional state and topic modeling to identify the specific trading issues they are facing.",
        "Time Series Analysis: Utilizes time series analysis techniques (e.g., ARIMA, LSTM) to forecast market trends and predict potential price movements. This information is used to refine the trading recommendations and provide traders with insights into market conditions.",
        "Model Selection: Initially, start with OpenAI's GPT-3.5 Turbo for chatbot interactions and general language understanding. For pattern recognition, explore training a custom model using scikit-learn or TensorFlow. Consider using embeddings (e.g., from Sentence Transformers) to represent trading strategies and user preferences in a vector space for similarity matching and personalized recommendations. Vector search can be implemented using Pinecone or Supabase vectors. Fine-tuning may be required for both the chatbot and pattern recognition models to improve accuracy and relevance."
