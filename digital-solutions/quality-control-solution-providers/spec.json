      "name": "AI-Powered Defect Prediction System",
      "overview": "The AI-Powered Defect Prediction System is a proactive solution designed to minimize defects in semiconductor manufacturing processes. It leverages machine learning to analyze historical and real-time data, identifying patterns and anomalies indicative of potential defects before they manifest. By predicting these vulnerabilities early in the production cycle, the system enables timely interventions, reducing material waste, rework, and overall production costs. This system focuses specifically on micro-crack prediction based on environmental factors, equipment performance, and material properties inherent to semiconductor fabrication.",

        "Machine Learning for Defect Prediction: Employs a combination of supervised and unsupervised learning techniques. Supervised learning models (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost, Neural Networks) are trained on historical data to predict defect occurrence. Unsupervised learning methods (e.g., anomaly detection algorithms) are used to identify unusual patterns in real-time data.",
        "Anomaly Detection: Utilizes algorithms like Isolation Forest or One-Class SVM to identify deviations from normal operating conditions. These anomalies serve as early warning signals for potential defects.",
        "Root Cause Analysis: Uses feature importance analysis from the trained ML models (e.g., SHAP values) to identify the key factors contributing to defect prediction.",
        "Model Selection Notes: For initial prototyping, consider using scikit-learn models due to their ease of implementation and interpretability. For production, explore more advanced models like XGBoost or TensorFlow-based neural networks. For anomaly detection, Isolation Forest is a good starting point. Use OpenAI embeddings to represent equipment states; fine-tuning may be needed to optimize results for specific equipment types. Implement vector search with Pinecone for rapid retrieval of similar historical production runs."
