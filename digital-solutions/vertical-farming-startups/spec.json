      "name": "Yield Optimization AI",
      "overview": "The Yield Optimization AI is a comprehensive system designed to predict and optimize crop yields within vertical farms. It addresses the challenges of inconsistent production and the complexities of managing environmental factors to maximize output. By leveraging machine learning algorithms, the system analyzes a wide range of environmental data collected from sensors, along with plant health data derived from imagery, to provide actionable insights and recommendations. These recommendations focus on adjusting environmental controls (temperature, humidity, light spectrum) and nutrient solutions, enabling vertical farm operators to enhance crop yield, minimize waste, optimize resource utilization, and ultimately improve profitability. The system's predictive capabilities and prescriptive recommendations provide a data-driven approach to vertical farming, moving away from traditional trial-and-error methods. The Yield Optimization AI integrates seamlessly with existing vertical farm infrastructure and management systems, providing a user-friendly interface for accessing predictions and implementing recommendations. This leads to a more sustainable and efficient agricultural practice.",

      "user_journeys": [
        "A crop manager logs into the Yield Optimization AI dashboard. The dashboard displays current environmental conditions (temperature, humidity, light levels) and predicted yield for different sections of the farm. The system flags a potential issue in Zone 3, where the predicted lettuce yield is 10% below the target. The manager clicks on Zone 3 to view detailed data and recommendations. The system recommends increasing the red light spectrum in Zone 3 during the final growth stage and adjusting the nutrient solution to increase potassium levels. The manager approves the recommendations, which are automatically implemented through the farm's environmental control system. The system monitors the effects of the changes and provides feedback on whether the interventions improved the yield."
