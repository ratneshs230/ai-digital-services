      "name": "AI-Powered Portfolio Forecaster",
      "overview": "The AI-Powered Portfolio Forecaster is a sophisticated tool designed to provide wealth managers, financial advisors, and portfolio managers with accurate and data-driven insights into future portfolio performance. By leveraging machine learning models trained on extensive historical market data, economic indicators, and client-specific financial information, the system generates probabilistic forecasts that enable more informed decision-making and improved client communication. The service aims to address the challenges of accurately predicting portfolio returns and effectively managing risk in increasingly volatile markets. It provides a transparent and customizable platform that empowers financial professionals to enhance client trust, increase assets under management (AUM), and optimize investment strategies. The core functionality includes scenario analysis, risk assessment, and personalized portfolio projections, all delivered through an intuitive and user-friendly interface. This ensures that financial professionals can easily integrate the tool into their existing workflows and deliver superior value to their clients.",
