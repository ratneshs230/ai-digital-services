      "overview": "This service provides an intelligent loan recommendation engine that analyzes applicant financial data and goals to suggest the most suitable loan products. By leveraging AI, the engine streamlines the loan selection process for applicants, reduces the workload of loan officers, and ultimately increases loan application conversion rates and customer satisfaction. The engine integrates with existing loan origination systems and presents personalized loan options through a user-friendly interface, complete with explanations and justifications for each recommendation.",
