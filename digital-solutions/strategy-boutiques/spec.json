        "A consultant logs into StratAI. They select a specific client and the relevant industry. The dashboard displays an overview of the competitive landscape, highlighting key competitors and their recent activities. The consultant clicks on a competitor to view a detailed analysis of their strategy, including strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats. StratAI predicts that the competitor is planning to launch a new product in the next quarter. The consultant receives an alert and analyzes the potential impact on their client. Based on these insights, the consultant recommends that their client preemptively launch a competing product and adjust their marketing strategy."
