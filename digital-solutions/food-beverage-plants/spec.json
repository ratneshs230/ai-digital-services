      "name": "AI-Powered Predictive Maintenance",
      "overview": "The AI-Powered Predictive Maintenance service is designed to minimize equipment downtime and reduce maintenance costs in manufacturing environments. By leveraging real-time sensor data and machine learning algorithms, the system predicts potential equipment failures before they occur. This proactive approach allows maintenance managers to schedule maintenance activities during planned downtime, preventing unexpected breakdowns and optimizing production schedules. The service integrates seamlessly with existing industrial IoT (IIoT) infrastructure and provides actionable insights through a user-friendly dashboard, empowering maintenance teams to make data-driven decisions and improve overall equipment effectiveness (OEE).",
