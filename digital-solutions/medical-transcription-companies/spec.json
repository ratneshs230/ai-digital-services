      "name": "AI-Powered Medical Summarization",
      "overview": "This service leverages artificial intelligence to automatically generate concise and structured summaries of medical records, patient encounters, and other healthcare-related documents. By intelligently analyzing transcribed reports, clinical notes, and discharge summaries, the system identifies key information such as diagnoses, treatments, medications, allergies, and relevant medical history. The summaries are formatted for quick review, significantly reducing the time physicians and other healthcare professionals spend sifting through lengthy documents. This improves information accessibility, enhances clinical decision-making, and streamlines administrative processes.",

        "Automated Medical Record Summarization – AI-powered analysis of medical documents to extract key information and generate concise summaries, customizable by document type and user preference.",
        "Key Information Extraction – Identification and highlighting of critical details, including diagnoses, medications, allergies, procedures, and lab results within the summaries.",
        "Structured Summary Generation – Creation of structured summaries with standardized sections, such as patient history, chief complaint, physical exam findings, and treatment plan.",
        "Customizable Summary Length – Allows users to adjust the length of the summary to meet their specific needs and preferences, ranging from brief overviews to more detailed synopses.",
