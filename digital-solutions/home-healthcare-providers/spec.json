      "name": "AI-Powered Medication Adherence Monitor",
      "overview": "The AI-Powered Medication Adherence Monitor is a comprehensive system designed to improve medication adherence among patients, particularly seniors and those with chronic conditions. It leverages computer vision and voice recognition technologies integrated into a smart home device and mobile application to ensure medications are taken correctly and on time. The system observes patients during medication intake, provides voice prompts and reminders, analyzes the actions using AI, and generates detailed adherence reports. Discrepancies or missed doses trigger alerts to caregivers, enabling timely intervention and improved care management. This solution aims to reduce hospital readmissions, improve patient health outcomes, and lower overall healthcare costs by addressing the critical issue of medication non-adherence.  The smart home device will use edge computing to process the video feed, while the mobile application provides a user-friendly interface for patients, caregivers, and healthcare providers to track adherence and manage medication schedules. Secure data transmission and storage are paramount, complying with all relevant healthcare regulations.  The system also incorporates machine learning models to personalize reminders and optimize the timing of prompts based on individual patient behavior.  This personalized approach ensures that reminders are effective without being intrusive, fostering better adherence habits.  The system is designed to seamlessly integrate with existing healthcare systems, such as electronic health records (EHRs) and pharmacy databases, to provide a holistic view of patient medication management.",

      "user_journeys": [
        "Patient logs into the mobile app and sets up their medication schedule, including medication names, dosages, and timing.  The patient places their medication within view of the smart home device's camera.  When the scheduled time arrives, the device provides a voice prompt reminding the patient to take their medication.  The patient takes the medication, and the camera records the action.  The AI analyzes the video to verify the medication, dosage, and timing.  The system records the adherence event and updates the adherence report. If a dose is missed, the device provides escalating reminders, and if still missed, an alert is sent to the caregiver."

      "ai_capabilities": [
        "Object Detection (Computer Vision) – Utilizes a pre-trained or fine-tuned object detection model (e.g., YOLOv8, SSD) to identify medication containers, pills, and capsules.  The model must be trained on a diverse dataset of medication images to ensure accurate identification across different brands and packaging.",
        "Action Recognition (Computer Vision) – Employs an action recognition model (e.g., TimeSformer, VideoBERT) to analyze patient actions during medication intake, such as picking up the medication, opening the container, and swallowing the medication.  The model will determine if the correct action (taking medication) is performed.",
        "Voice Recognition (NLP) – Integrates a speech-to-text engine (e.g., Google Cloud Speech-to-Text, AssemblyAI) to process patient responses to voice prompts and confirm medication intake.",
        "Anomaly Detection (ML) – Implements an anomaly detection algorithm (e.g., Isolation Forest, One-Class SVM) to identify deviations from the patient's typical medication intake behavior, such as taking the wrong medication or skipping a dose. Fine-tuning considerations: The object detection model should be fine-tuned on a dataset of prescription drugs in the target user's area. The action recognition model needs to be trained with video clips of people taking medication. Embeddings: Medication names can be embedded for similarity search. Vector Search: If the system grows to include many users, vector search can be used to identify potential adverse events based on similar medication combinations."
