      "overview": "The AI-Powered Predictive Maintenance Advisor is a SaaS platform designed to optimize maintenance schedules, reduce unplanned equipment downtime, and extend the lifespan of critical assets within manufacturing facilities. The service ingests real-time sensor data from industrial equipment, applies advanced machine learning algorithms to predict potential failures, and provides actionable recommendations to maintenance personnel. By integrating with existing Computerized Maintenance Management Systems (CMMS), the Predictive Maintenance Advisor streamlines workflows and empowers organizations to transition from reactive to proactive maintenance strategies. The platform aims to minimize disruptions to production schedules, reduce maintenance costs, and improve overall equipment effectiveness (OEE).",

Recommends specific maintenance tasks (e.g., inspection, lubrication, repair, replacement) and their optimal timing.",
        "CMMS Integration: Seamlessly integrates with existing CMMS systems (e.g., SAP PM, Maximo, Infor EAM) to automatically create work orders, update equipment records, and track maintenance activities.  Supports bi-directional data synchronization.",
        "Customizable Alerting and Reporting: Configurable alerts notify maintenance personnel of impending equipment failures. Generates detailed reports on equipment health, maintenance performance, and cost savings.  Reports can be customized based on user roles and preferences.",
        "Equipment Health Dashboard: Provides a visual overview of equipment health status, including key performance indicators (KPIs) such as mean time between failures (MTBF), mean time to repair (MTTR), and overall equipment effectiveness (OEE).",
        "Anomaly Detection: Identifies unusual patterns in sensor data that may indicate early signs of equipment degradation or impending failure.  Uses statistical methods and machine learning algorithms to detect anomalies.",
        "Root Cause Analysis: Provides tools to investigate the underlying causes of equipment failures based on historical data and expert knowledge. Uses fault tree analysis and other techniques to identify potential root causes.",

      ],
      "user_journeys": [
        "A maintenance manager logs into the Predictive Maintenance Advisor dashboard. They review the equipment health overview and notice a pump showing a high probability of failure within the next two weeks. They drill down into the pump's details, review the sensor data and failure prediction analysis, and accept the recommended maintenance schedule. The system automatically creates a work order in their CMMS, scheduling a pump replacement during the next planned downtime. The pump is replaced proactively, avoiding an unplanned production shutdown."
