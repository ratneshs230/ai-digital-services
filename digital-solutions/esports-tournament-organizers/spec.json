      "user_journeys": [
        "**Tournament Organizer Setup:** User logs into the platform, connects to the game server API, configures broadcast settings (branding, commentary style, streaming platform), and starts the broadcast. The AI then automatically manages camera switching, commentary, and highlight reel creation throughout the tournament.",
        "**Broadcaster Customization:** User uploads custom assets, sets up scenes, and configures AI parameters to tailor broadcast style and focus. User monitors audience engagement and adjusts AI parameters on the fly to optimize the viewing experience.",
        "**Viewer Experience:** Viewer watches the live stream on their preferred platform. The AI dynamically adjusts the broadcast based on gameplay events and audience sentiment, creating a personalized viewing experience. After the match, the viewer can watch an automatically generated highlight reel."

      "ai_capabilities": [
        "**Gameplay Analysis:** Uses a combination of rule-based systems and machine learning models to analyze game data. This includes identifying key events, predicting player behavior, and assessing the overall flow of the game.",
        "**Camera Angle Optimization:** Employs a reinforcement learning model trained on esports gameplay footage to determine the optimal camera angle at any given moment. The model is fine-tuned on different game types and player skill levels.",
        "**Commentary Generation:** Leverages a large language model (e.g., GPT-3.5 Turbo or GPT-4) fine-tuned on esports terminology and player data to generate real-time commentary. Sentiment analysis is used to adjust the commentary tone and content based on audience reactions.",
        "**Highlight Detection:** Utilizes a combination of rule-based systems and machine learning models to identify the most exciting moments and key plays in a match. This includes detecting kill streaks, objective captures, and clutch plays.",
        "**Sentiment Analysis:** Employs a natural language processing (NLP) model to analyze audience sentiment in real-time via chat and social media. This information is used to adjust commentary and highlight selection, creating a personalized viewing experience.",
        "**Model Selection Notes:** OpenAI models (GPT-3.5 Turbo, GPT-4) are preferred for commentary generation due to their fluency and ability to generate creative content. Embeddings and vector search can be used to improve the relevance and accuracy of the commentary. Fine-tuning the models on specific esports games and player data is crucial for optimal performance."
