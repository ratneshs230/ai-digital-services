      "name": "Material Defect Detection AI",
      "overview": "The Material Defect Detection AI is an AI-powered visual inspection system designed to automate the identification of defects in building materials during the manufacturing process. This system leverages computer vision and deep learning techniques to analyze images and videos of materials on the production line, identifying anomalies and defects in real-time. By automating this process, manufacturers can reduce waste, improve product quality, lower inspection costs, and increase customer satisfaction. The system provides a robust and consistent alternative to manual visual inspection, which is often slow, inconsistent, and prone to human error. Ultimately, this service enhances operational efficiency and product reliability.",
