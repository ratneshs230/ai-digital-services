      "overview": "The Predictive Maintenance AI service is a comprehensive solution designed to minimize unscheduled downtime, reduce maintenance costs, and extend the lifespan of industrial equipment. It leverages machine learning algorithms to analyze real-time sensor data, historical maintenance records, and operational parameters to predict potential equipment failures. The system generates actionable insights, including alerts and recommended maintenance schedules, enabling plant managers and maintenance engineers to proactively address issues before they escalate into critical failures. This service aims to optimize maintenance operations, improve overall operational efficiency, and provide a significant return on investment through reduced downtime and improved equipment performance.",
