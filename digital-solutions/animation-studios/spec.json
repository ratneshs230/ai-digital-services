      "name": "AI Storyboard Assistant",
      "overview": "The AI Storyboard Assistant is a revolutionary tool designed to streamline and accelerate the storyboard creation process for animators and animation directors. By leveraging advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Computer Vision techniques, this tool automatically generates storyboard panels directly from script descriptions. This significantly reduces the time and effort traditionally required for manual storyboard creation, enabling artists to focus on refining their visual narratives and exploring a wider range of creative possibilities. The assistant intelligently suggests camera angles, compositions, and character poses based on established animation best practices, providing a solid foundation for visual storytelling. It fosters rapid iteration and exploration, empowering users to quickly visualize and refine their ideas. This system is built for Vercel deployment with a focus on performance, scalability, and maintainability.",

        "Script Input and Parsing: Allows users to input script descriptions in various formats (text, script files) and parses them to identify key elements such as character actions, scene settings, and dialogue.",
        "AI-Powered Panel Generation: Generates storyboard panels based on the parsed script, suggesting visual compositions, camera angles (e.g., close-up, wide shot, over-the-shoulder), and character poses.",
        "Customizable Art Style: Offers a range of pre-defined art styles (e.g., cartoon, anime, realistic) and allows users to customize these styles to match the project's aesthetic. Supports user-uploaded style references.",
        "Panel Editing and Refinement: Provides tools for users to edit and refine the generated panels, including drawing tools, element manipulation, and the ability to add notes and annotations.",
        "Scene and Shot Sequencing: Enables users to arrange and sequence the generated panels to create a cohesive storyboard, ensuring smooth transitions between scenes and shots.",

The AI Storyboard Assistant parses the script and generates initial storyboard panel options.\n4. User reviews the generated panels and uses the editing tools to refine compositions, camera angles, and character poses.\n5. User arranges the panels into a sequence, adds notes and annotations, and collaborates with other team members.\n6. User exports the completed storyboard in the desired format for use in the animation pipeline."
