      "overview": "This service provides predictive maintenance capabilities for warehouse automation systems. By leveraging machine learning algorithms, the system analyzes sensor data, historical maintenance records, and environmental factors to forecast potential equipment failures. Early detection of impending failures enables proactive maintenance interventions, minimizing unplanned downtime, reducing maintenance costs, and extending the lifespan of critical warehouse equipment. The system provides a user-friendly interface for monitoring equipment health, viewing predictive maintenance alerts, and scheduling maintenance tasks. It integrates seamlessly with existing warehouse management systems (WMS) and computerized maintenance management systems (CMMS).",

      "user_journeys": [
        "A maintenance engineer logs into the system, views the equipment health dashboard, notices a high probability of failure for a specific conveyor belt motor. The engineer investigates the sensor data and confirms the anomaly. They then schedule a maintenance task to replace the motor during the next scheduled downtime, avoiding a potential system shutdown."
