      "name": "AI Scene Augmenter",
      "overview": "The AI Scene Augmenter is a cloud-based service designed to automate and enhance the process of creating detailed and realistic virtual environments. It leverages advanced AI models to generate and seamlessly integrate realistic details, such as foliage, textures, lighting effects, and atmospheric elements, into existing 3D scenes. The service consumes high-level scene descriptions and user-provided prompts as input and outputs augmented 3D scene data compatible with industry-standard DCC (Digital Content Creation) tools. This significantly reduces the manual effort required from artists, accelerates scene creation workflows, and enhances the overall visual fidelity of virtual environments. The service is offered as a subscription-based SaaS platform with tiered pricing based on usage and feature access.",

      "user_journeys": [
        "1. User logs in to the AI Scene Augmenter platform.\n2. User uploads a base 3D scene (e.g., a building model) in a supported format (FBX, OBJ, glTF).\n3. User defines the scene context (e.g., \"urban street\", \"forest edge\") and provides specific prompts (e.g., \"add ivy growing on the wall\", \"generate moss patches on the roof tiles\", \"add puddles on the pavement\").\n4. User adjusts parameters such as detail density, style, and randomness to fine-tune the detail generation process.\n5. The AI Scene Augmenter processes the scene and generates the requested details, seamlessly integrating them into the base model.\n6. User previews the augmented scene in the platform's interactive viewer.\n7. User iteratively refines the prompts and parameters until the desired level of detail and realism is achieved.\n8. User downloads the augmented scene in the desired output format (FBX, OBJ, glTF) and imports it into their DCC tool for further editing and rendering."

Initial prototype can be built with pre-trained models available on Hugging Face, then fine-tuned with proprietary data. Embeddings and Vector search are not the primary focus for scene augmentation, but can be used for style references."
