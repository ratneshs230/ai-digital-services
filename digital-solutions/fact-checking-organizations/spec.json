      "overview": "Claim Prioritization AI is an AI-powered service designed to automatically identify, analyze, and prioritize viral and potentially harmful claims circulating online. This tool addresses the significant challenge faced by fact-checking organizations, journalists, and media outlets in manually sifting through vast amounts of online content to pinpoint the most impactful misinformation. By leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning, the system analyzes the velocity, reach, sentiment, and potential harm associated with online claims, providing a prioritized ranking that enables rapid and effective fact-checking. This service is designed to significantly increase the efficiency and impact of fact-checking efforts, ensuring that resources are focused on debunking the most critical and widespread misinformation.",

        "A fact-checker logs into the Claim Prioritization AI dashboard. The dashboard displays a ranked list of the most viral and potentially harmful claims currently circulating online. The fact-checker selects a high-priority claim related to vaccine safety. The system provides detailed metrics on the claim's reach, velocity, and sentiment. The fact-checker uses this information to quickly assess the claim's potential impact and initiates the fact-checking process, leveraging the provided data to create a timely and effective debunking article."

        "Machine learning for harm assessment: Employs a machine learning model trained on a dataset of labeled claims to predict the potential harm of a new claim. Features include claim content, source credibility, target audience, and historical impact of similar claims.  Consider using a classification model like XGBoost or LightGBM.",
