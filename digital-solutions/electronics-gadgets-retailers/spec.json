        "Preference Input – A user-friendly interface that allows customers to input their budget, desired features (e.g., battery life, screen size), intended use case (e.g., gaming, travel), and brand preferences. This interface should support both free-text input and structured selections (e.g., dropdown menus, sliders).",
        "AI-Powered Recommendation Engine – This is the core of the service, using machine learning models to analyze customer inputs and generate a ranked list of product recommendations. The engine should consider multiple factors, including product specifications, customer reviews, and historical sales data. Model training should incorporate feedback loops to improve recommendation accuracy over time.",
        "Recommendation Explanation – Each product recommendation is accompanied by a detailed explanation highlighting why the product is a good fit based on the customer's specified needs. This explanation should translate technical specifications into understandable benefits for the user (e.g., 'This laptop's long battery life makes it ideal for travel.').",
        "Product Comparison – The system allows customers to compare recommended products side-by-side, highlighting key differences and similarities. This feature should present information in a visually clear and concise manner, making it easy for customers to evaluate their options.",
        "Integration with E-commerce Platform – Seamless integration with the existing e-commerce platform to display product recommendations on product pages, search results pages, and personalized landing pages. The integration should also allow for tracking customer interactions with the recommendations to improve model performance."
