      "overview": "The Cognitive RPA Process Discovery service is an AI-powered solution designed to automatically identify and document optimal processes for Robotic Process Automation (RPA) within financial institutions. It addresses the challenge of inefficient and time-consuming manual process discovery, enabling faster RPA implementation and improved ROI. The service analyzes user activity, system logs, and application data to pinpoint repetitive tasks and process patterns, generating detailed process maps and actionable RPA recommendations. This allows financial institutions to strategically prioritize automation efforts, focusing on high-impact opportunities that yield the greatest efficiency gains and cost savings. By automating the process discovery phase, organizations can significantly reduce the manual effort required, freeing up valuable resources for other critical initiatives. The tool provides a comprehensive view of operational workflows, identifies bottlenecks, and offers data-driven insights to optimize processes before automation.",

        "A Business Analyst logs into the Cognitive RPA Process Discovery platform. They upload system logs and grant access to application data. The system analyzes the data and generates a process map for the loan origination process. The Business Analyst reviews the map, identifies a data entry bottleneck, and uses the RPA Recommendation Engine to confirm its suitability for automation. They then generate a detailed report outlining the potential cost savings and efficiency gains from automating this process, which they present to the IT department for implementation."
