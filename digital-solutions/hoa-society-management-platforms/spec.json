      "name": "AI-Powered Rule Violation Detection",
      "overview": "This service leverages computer vision and machine learning to automate the detection of HOA rule violations. Residents can submit photos and videos through a mobile app or web portal, which are then analyzed by AI models to identify potential infractions such as unapproved property modifications, parking violations, pet restrictions, and landscaping issues. The system flags potential violations for review by HOA managers or board members, significantly reducing the time and effort required for manual monitoring and enforcement. The goal is to improve rule enforcement consistency, reduce administrative overhead, and enhance resident satisfaction by ensuring fair and efficient handling of violations.",
      "problems_addressed": [
        "Time-consuming manual review of rule violation reports.",
        "Inconsistent rule enforcement due to subjective human judgment.",
        "Delayed response to violations, leading to escalation and dissatisfaction.",

        "A resident observes a parking violation and uses the mobile app to take a photo and submit a report. The AI system analyzes the photo, confirms the violation (e.g., parking in a no-parking zone), and automatically sends a warning notice to the vehicle owner. The HOA manager reviews the case and can escalate if necessary. The entire process is tracked and documented in the system.",
        "An HOA board member notices an unapproved modification to a property's landscaping. They submit the images through the admin portal. The AI identifies the changes as being outside of the approved guidelines. A notification is sent to the homeowner, with options to revert the changes or apply for post-approval.",
