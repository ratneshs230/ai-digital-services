        "1. Device sensors collect real-time data and transmit it to the Predictive Maintenance AI platform.\n2. The AI algorithms analyze the sensor data and identify patterns indicative of potential failures.\n3. If a potential failure is predicted, the system generates an automated alert and sends it to the maintenance personnel via email, SMS, or mobile app notification.\n4. The maintenance personnel review the alert details and schedule maintenance activities accordingly, such as ordering replacement parts or dispatching a technician.\n5. The maintenance activities are performed, and the device is restored to optimal working condition, preventing a potential failure and minimizing downtime.\n6. The system tracks and records all maintenance activities, providing valuable data for performance reporting and analytics."
