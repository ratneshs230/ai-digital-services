      "name": "PanelAI: AI-Powered Comic Panel Layout Assistant",
      "overview": "PanelAI is an AI-powered assistant designed to streamline and enhance the comic book panel layout and composition process. It leverages computer vision and machine learning to analyze comic scripts, character emotions, and scene context, providing artists with intelligent panel layout suggestions. These suggestions consider visual balance, pacing, readability, and overall storytelling impact, helping artists create more engaging and visually compelling comics. PanelAI aims to reduce the time and effort spent on panel design, improve the consistency and quality of visual storytelling, and ultimately boost reader engagement. The service also helps artists learn effective visual storytelling techniques by showcasing diverse and optimized panel arrangements. It will integrate directly into existing digital art workflows, functioning as an assistant rather than a complete replacement of the artist's creative control.",
