      "name": "EcoAI: Environmental Impact Assessment Automation",
      "overview": "EcoAI is an AI-powered platform designed to automate and accelerate the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) process. It leverages machine learning, natural language processing, and computer vision to analyze diverse data sources, predict environmental impacts, generate comprehensive reports, and suggest effective mitigation strategies. By automating traditionally manual and time-consuming tasks, EcoAI significantly reduces the cost and time associated with EIAs while improving the accuracy and consistency of assessments. The platform provides environmental consultants, project developers, and government agencies with a powerful tool to make informed decisions, streamline project approvals, and promote sustainable development.",
