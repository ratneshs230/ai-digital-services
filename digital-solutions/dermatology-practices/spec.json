      "name": "AI-Powered Teledermatology Triage",
      "overview": "This service provides an AI-driven initial assessment of patient-submitted images and symptom questionnaires to streamline virtual dermatology consultations. The primary goal is to automate the triage process, enabling dermatologists to focus on high-priority cases while improving patient access to timely care. By analyzing submitted data, the AI identifies potential skin conditions, assesses their severity, and automatically prioritizes patients for scheduling. This reduces the administrative burden on dermatologists, optimizes consultation scheduling, and enhances the overall efficiency of teledermatology practices. The system integrates seamlessly with existing EMR/EHR systems and telemedicine platforms, ensuring a cohesive and streamlined workflow. It also includes features for continuous monitoring and improvement of AI model accuracy through feedback loops and regular retraining.",

        "Image Analysis: AI-powered analysis of patient-submitted images using computer vision to identify potential skin conditions and anomalies (e.g., moles, rashes, lesions). The AI will need to differentiate images of moles from other similar marks on the body.",

        "Severity Scoring: Generation of a severity score based on image analysis and symptom assessment to prioritize patients based on the urgency of their condition. For example, a user submitting images of Melanoma would be triaged as high-priority.",

        "3. The AI analyzes the submitted images and questionnaire data.",
        "4. The AI assigns a severity score and triage level to the patient.",
        "5. The patient receives a notification with the triage result and recommended next steps (e.g., schedule a virtual consultation).",
        "6. If a consultation is recommended, the patient can schedule a virtual appointment with an available dermatologist through the platform.",
        "7. The dermatologist reviews the patient's submitted information and triage results prior to the virtual consultation.",
        "8. After the consultation, the dermatologist can provide feedback on the accuracy of the AI triage to improve future performance."
