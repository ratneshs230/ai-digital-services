      "name": "Predictive Inventory Optimization for OEM Parts",
      "overview": "This service provides an AI-powered inventory management solution specifically tailored for OEM parts suppliers. It addresses the critical challenges of balancing inventory levels to meet demand while minimizing holding costs and preventing stockouts. By leveraging machine learning algorithms, the system analyzes historical sales data, market trends, and customer forecasts to accurately predict demand for specific parts. This enables automated adjustments to inventory levels and the generation of optimized purchase orders, leading to significant improvements in efficiency and profitability. The solution integrates seamlessly with existing ERP and CRM systems to provide a holistic view of the supply chain.",

        "High inventory holding costs due to overstocking of slow-moving parts.",
        "Frequent stockouts of critical components leading to production delays and customer dissatisfaction.",
        "Inefficient manual processes for demand forecasting and purchase order generation.",
        "Lack of visibility into real-time inventory levels across multiple locations.",
        "Inability to adapt quickly to changing market conditions and customer demand."

      "core_features": [
        "Demand Forecasting: Uses machine learning algorithms (time series analysis, regression models) to predict demand for each part based on historical sales data, seasonality, market trends, and external factors (e.g., automotive production forecasts).",
        "Inventory Optimization: Automatically calculates optimal inventory levels (reorder points, safety stock levels) for each part, considering lead times, demand variability, and cost factors. Utilizes optimization algorithms to minimize total inventory costs.",
        "Automated Purchase Order Generation: Generates purchase orders automatically based on predicted demand and inventory levels, taking into account supplier lead times, minimum order quantities, and pricing agreements. Purchase orders are routed for approval based on predefined rules.",
        "Real-time Inventory Tracking: Provides a real-time view of inventory levels across all locations, including warehouses, distribution centers, and manufacturing plants. Integrates with existing warehouse management systems (WMS) to capture inventory movements.",
        "Alerting and Notifications: Sends alerts and notifications to relevant stakeholders when inventory levels fall below safety stock levels, when demand exceeds forecasts, or when there are potential supply chain disruptions. Configurable alert thresholds and delivery methods.",
        "Reporting and Analytics: Provides comprehensive reporting and analytics dashboards that track key inventory metrics, such as inventory turnover, fill rates, stockout rates, and inventory holding costs. Generates customized reports to identify trends and opportunities for improvement."

        "1. Inventory Manager logs into the system.\n2. Navigates to the inventory dashboard to view current stock levels, demand forecasts, and purchase order status.\n3. Reviews alerts for parts with low stock levels or potential stockouts.\n4. Drills down into a specific part to view its demand history, forecast, and inventory optimization recommendations.\n5. Approves or modifies automatically generated purchase orders.\n6. Monitors the status of purchase orders and inventory levels in real-time.\n7. Runs reports to analyze inventory performance and identify areas for improvement."

        "Anomaly Detection to identify unusual demand patterns or supply chain disruptions that may require attention.",
        "Model Selection Notes: Use of Prophet for initial time-series forecasting, with potential for fine-tuning using Random Forest or Gradient Boosting if external features significantly impact demand. Embeddings and vector search are not directly applicable, but demand signals can be used as features for future model enhancements."
