      "name": "AI-Powered Predictive Maintenance",
      "overview": "This service utilizes machine learning to predict equipment failures in manufacturing environments before they occur. By analyzing real-time sensor data and historical maintenance records, the system identifies patterns and anomalies indicative of potential failures. This enables proactive maintenance scheduling, minimizing unscheduled downtime, reducing maintenance costs, and improving overall production efficiency. The service provides actionable insights to maintenance engineers and operations managers, allowing them to optimize maintenance strategies and resource allocation. The core of the service lies in its ability to learn from data, continuously refine its predictive models, and adapt to the specific operational characteristics of each piece of equipment.",

        "A maintenance engineer logs into the system, views a dashboard displaying the health status of all monitored equipment. An alert indicates a high probability of failure for a specific hydraulic pump within the next 72 hours. The engineer clicks on the alert to view detailed sensor data, failure prediction analysis, and recommended maintenance actions. The engineer schedules a maintenance task to replace the pump during the next scheduled downtime. The system automatically updates the CMMS system with the scheduled maintenance task. After the pump is replaced, the engineer confirms the completion of the task in the system. The system updates its historical data and refines its predictive model based on the new information."
