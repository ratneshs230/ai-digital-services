      "overview": "The Skill Gap Analyzer is an AI-powered tool designed to identify and quantify skill gaps within an organization. By analyzing employee performance data, job descriptions, and industry trends, the tool provides actionable insights for targeted training and development initiatives. It leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) to extract skills from text-based data, and Machine Learning (ML) to predict future skill needs based on company goals and market demands. This allows companies to proactively address skill deficiencies, optimize training budgets, and improve overall employee performance and retention. The tool integrates seamlessly with existing HR systems and provides customizable reports and dashboards for easy interpretation and tracking of progress.",

        "An HR manager logs into the Skill Gap Analyzer platform, uploads recent employee performance reviews and a set of job descriptions. The system extracts relevant skills from both data sets, identifies discrepancies, and generates a report highlighting the most prevalent skill gaps across different departments. Based on the report, the HR manager can then assign targeted training programs to specific employees to address those skill gaps."
