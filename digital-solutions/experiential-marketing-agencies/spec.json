        "Machine Learning for Campaign Recommendation: Recommends optimal event elements based on audience data and past campaign performance. Uses collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, and regression models. Considers factors like event type, location, activities, and messaging. Model selection should initially focus on XGBoost or LightGBM due to their robustness and ability to handle mixed data types. Evaluate the need for fine-tuning on proprietary campaign data as more data becomes available. OpenAI models like GPT-3.5 or GPT-4 can be used to generate creative content and messaging variations for A/B testing.",

Uses sentiment analysis, topic modeling, and named entity recognition. Pre-trained models from Hugging Face Transformers (e.g., BERT, RoBERTa) can be fine-tuned for sentiment classification and topic extraction. Consider using OpenAI's text embedding models to vectorize feedback and perform similarity analysis.",
        "Statistical Analysis for A/B Testing: Identifies statistically significant differences in performance between different event elements. Uses t-tests, ANOVA, and chi-squared tests. Consider bayesian A/B testing for faster and more accurate results."
