      "name": "Leak Detection AI",
      "overview": "Leak Detection AI is a real-time platform designed to detect and predict water pipeline leaks using advanced machine learning algorithms. By analyzing data from various sensors, including pressure, flow, and acoustic sensors, the system identifies anomalies that indicate potential leaks. This proactive approach enables water utilities to minimize water loss, reduce operational costs, and mitigate environmental impact. The platform provides timely alerts with precise location estimates and severity levels, allowing maintenance teams to address issues promptly and efficiently. Ultimately, Leak Detection AI enhances water resource management and improves the overall operational efficiency of water distribution networks.",

        "Real-time Anomaly Detection – Continuously analyzes sensor data to identify deviations from normal patterns, indicating potential leaks. Includes configurable sensitivity levels and threshold settings.",
        "Predictive Leak Forecasting – Uses historical data and machine learning models to forecast the likelihood of future leaks in specific pipeline sections. This includes risk scoring based on environmental factors, pipe age, and historical leak data.",
        "Location Estimation – Provides precise location estimates of detected leaks using sensor data triangulation and geographic information system (GIS) integration. This feature also visualizes leak locations on a map interface.",
        "Severity Assessment – Evaluates the severity of detected leaks based on factors such as flow rate, pressure drop, and acoustic signal intensity, categorizing them into levels like low, medium, and high. Custom alert thresholds are configurable per utility.",
        "Alerting and Notification System – Sends immediate alerts via SMS, email, and in-app notifications to relevant personnel upon leak detection, including detailed information on location and severity. Role-based alerting is supported.",

      "user_journeys": [
        "A water utility engineer logs into the Leak Detection AI platform. The dashboard displays real-time sensor data, including pressure, flow, and acoustic readings across the water distribution network. An anomaly is detected in a specific pipeline section, triggering an alert. The engineer reviews the alert details, including the location estimate and severity level. The engineer dispatches a maintenance team to investigate the potential leak. The maintenance team confirms the leak using the provided location data. After repair, the engineer updates the system with repair details, which are then used to refine the predictive models."

      "ai_capabilities": [
        "Anomaly Detection Model: Utilizes a combination of time-series analysis (ARIMA, LSTM) and anomaly detection algorithms (Isolation Forest, One-Class SVM) to identify deviations in sensor data that indicate potential leaks. Model selection will depend on data characteristics and performance metrics (precision, recall, F1-score).",
        "Leak Localization Model: Employs machine learning techniques such as Support Vector Regression (SVR) or Random Forest Regression to estimate the leak location based on sensor data inputs. This model is trained on historical leak events with known locations and corresponding sensor readings.",
        "Predictive Maintenance Model: Uses a classification model (e.g., XGBoost, Logistic Regression) to predict the likelihood of future leaks based on historical data, environmental factors, and pipe characteristics. Model selection is based on achieving high accuracy and interpretability.",
        "Model Selection Notes: OpenAI models are not directly applicable here. We need specialized time-series and regression models. Embeddings and vector search are not primary requirements but could be used to compare current sensor patterns with historical leak signatures. Fine-tuning these models with utility-specific data is crucial for optimal performance. Use scikit-learn, TensorFlow, or PyTorch for model development and training. Evaluate models using cross-validation and appropriate metrics (e.g., RMSE for location estimation, F1-score for anomaly detection)."
