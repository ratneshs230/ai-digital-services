      "name": "AI-Powered Creditworthiness Prediction for BNPL",
      "overview": "This service provides an AI-driven creditworthiness assessment specifically tailored for Buy Now, Pay Later (BNPL) lenders. It leverages alternative data sources and machine learning models to predict the likelihood of repayment, addressing the limitations of traditional credit scoring methods. By analyzing a wider array of data points, the system generates a more comprehensive risk profile, enabling BNPL providers to increase approval rates for underserved populations while simultaneously reducing default rates and improving overall profitability. The system integrates seamlessly into existing BNPL platforms through a secure API, providing real-time risk assessments and decision support. The core value proposition is to expand access to BNPL services while mitigating risk through more accurate and nuanced creditworthiness evaluations.",

      "user_journeys": [
        "A new user signs up for a BNPL service through the provider's app. The BNPL provider's system sends the user's application data, along with consent for alternative data collection, to the AI-powered creditworthiness prediction service API. The AI service aggregates data, assesses the user's risk profile, and returns a creditworthiness score to the BNPL provider. Based on the score and predefined risk thresholds, the BNPL provider automatically approves or denies the loan application. If approved, the user can immediately proceed with their purchase. If denied, the user receives an explanation of the key factors contributing to the decision."
