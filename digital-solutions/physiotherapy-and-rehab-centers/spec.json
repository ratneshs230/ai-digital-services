      "name": "AI-Powered Gait Analysis System",
      "overview": "This service provides real-time gait analysis using computer vision to identify biomechanical issues and track patient progress. It addresses the limitations of subjective gait assessments by offering objective, quantifiable data. The system analyzes video footage of patients walking or running, detecting deviations from optimal gait patterns and generating detailed reports. These reports include biomechanical metrics, visualizations of gait abnormalities, and personalized recommendations for treatment and training. The goal is to improve diagnostic accuracy, enable objective progress tracking, and facilitate the development of personalized intervention plans. By automating the analysis process, it also reduces the time and resources required for gait assessment, allowing clinicians to focus on patient care. The system integrates seamlessly into existing clinical workflows, providing a user-friendly interface for data capture, analysis, and reporting.",
