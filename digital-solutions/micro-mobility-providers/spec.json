      "overview": "This service provides predictive rebalancing of shared micromobility fleets (scooters, bikes) using machine learning models. It analyzes historical usage data, real-time event information, and environmental factors to forecast demand and proactively optimize vehicle distribution. The goal is to improve vehicle availability in high-demand areas, reduce operational costs associated with manual rebalancing, and increase overall customer satisfaction by minimizing instances of vehicles being unavailable when and where needed.",

        "Demand Forecasting Model: Uses time series forecasting (e.g., ARIMA, Prophet, or LSTM neural networks) to predict demand based on historical usage data, weather patterns, event schedules, and real-time demand signals. Features include time-of-day, day-of-week, location coordinates, weather conditions (temperature, precipitation), event attendance estimates, and promotions.",

        "Model Selection: Start with Prophet for time series forecasting due to its robustness and ease of use.  Evaluate LSTM networks for improved accuracy if sufficient data is available.  Use a dedicated optimization library (e.g., Google OR-Tools) for the rebalancing optimization model.  Consider fine-tuning models with local operational data for improved accuracy."
