      "name": "AI-Powered Lead Scoring & Prioritization",
      "overview": "This service provides an AI-driven solution for lead scoring and prioritization, specifically designed to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of telesales teams. It addresses the common challenges of inefficient lead handling, wasted time on low-potential leads, and missed revenue opportunities by leveraging machine learning to predict lead conversion probability. The system analyzes a wide range of lead data, including demographics, firmographics, online behavior, and past interactions, to generate a dynamic lead score. This score enables telesales teams to focus their efforts on the leads most likely to convert, maximizing their time and increasing revenue. The platform integrates seamlessly with existing CRM systems, providing a streamlined workflow from lead capture to qualified opportunity. Furthermore, it offers detailed analytics and reporting to track the performance of the AI model and the overall impact on sales metrics. Through continuous learning and adaptation, the AI model ensures that lead scores remain accurate and relevant, providing a sustained competitive advantage for telesales organizations.",
