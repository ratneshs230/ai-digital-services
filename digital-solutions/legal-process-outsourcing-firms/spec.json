      "name": "AI-Powered Contract Review",
      "overview": "The AI-Powered Contract Review service provides automated analysis of legal contracts, identifying potential risks, obligations, and key clauses using advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. It addresses the inefficiencies and potential for errors associated with manual contract review processes. By leveraging AI, the service delivers a comprehensive summary report, flags critical areas requiring attention, and ultimately reduces the time and cost associated with contract analysis. This enables legal professionals to make informed decisions more efficiently, mitigate risks, and ensure compliance with relevant regulations.",
