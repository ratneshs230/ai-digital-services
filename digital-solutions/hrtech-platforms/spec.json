        "Skills Gap Identification: Uses a combination of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) techniques to analyze text data (job descriptions, performance reviews, etc.) and structured data (employee profiles) to identify skills gaps. Specific algorithms include: TF-IDF for keyword extraction, sentiment analysis for performance review interpretation, and collaborative filtering for personalized training recommendations.",
        "Training Recommendation Engine: Employs a recommendation engine based on collaborative filtering and content-based filtering techniques. It uses employee skill profiles, learning preferences, and training program metadata to recommend relevant training resources. Considers both internal and external training providers.",
        "Model Selection Notes: The platform uses OpenAI's embedding models (e.g., text-embedding-ada-002) to generate vector embeddings for job descriptions, employee skills, and training materials. These embeddings are stored in a vector database (Pinecone or Supabase vectors) for efficient similarity search. For personalized recommendations, consider fine-tuning a custom recommendation model using scikit-learn or TensorFlow, based on historical training data and employee feedback. For ongoing skills gap detection, periodic retraining of the NLP models is necessary to adapt to evolving industry trends."
