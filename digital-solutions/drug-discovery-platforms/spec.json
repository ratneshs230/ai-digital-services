      "overview": "The AI-Driven Target Identification Platform is a SaaS solution designed to accelerate and improve the drug discovery process by leveraging artificial intelligence and machine learning to identify novel drug targets. This platform analyzes vast datasets of genomic, proteomic, metabolomic, and clinical data to predict potential drug targets, assess their viability, and prioritize the most promising candidates for further investigation. By automating and enhancing the target identification process, the platform helps pharmaceutical companies, biotech firms, and research institutions reduce the time and cost associated with drug development, increase the likelihood of identifying effective drug targets, and ultimately expand revenue through the development of new drugs.",
