      "name": "AI-Powered Lead Scoring & Prioritization",
      "overview": "This service leverages machine learning to automatically score and prioritize real estate leads based on their likelihood to convert into clients. It addresses the critical problem of agents spending excessive time on cold leads, hindering their ability to focus on high-potential prospects. The system analyzes various lead data points, including demographics, online behavior (property views, saved searches), and engagement metrics, to predict conversion probability and assign a corresponding score. This score is then seamlessly integrated into the agent's CRM workflow, enabling automated prioritization of leads and ensuring that agents focus their efforts on the most promising opportunities. The service ultimately aims to increase conversion rates, improve lead management efficiency, and drive higher revenue per agent by optimizing their time and focus.",
      "problems_addressed": [
        "Real estate agents waste significant time on cold leads with low conversion potential.",
        "High-potential leads are often missed or not followed up on promptly due to inefficient lead management processes.",
        "Lead qualification is often subjective and inconsistent, leading to missed opportunities and inaccurate resource allocation."

        "Automated Lead Scoring: A machine learning model analyzes lead data and assigns a score representing the likelihood of conversion.",
        "Behavioral Analysis: The system tracks lead behavior on the real estate platform (property views, saved searches, inquiries) to identify intent and adjust lead scores accordingly.",
        "CRM Integration: Seamless integration with popular CRM systems (e.g., Salesforce, HubSpot, Follow Up Boss) allows for automated lead prioritization within the agent's existing workflow.",
        "Customizable Scoring Model: The scoring model can be customized based on specific real estate market conditions, property types, and agent preferences.",
        "Real-Time Alerts: Agents receive real-time notifications when a lead's score changes significantly, indicating a shift in interest or urgency."

      "user_journeys": [
        "A new lead is captured through the real estate website inquiry form. The lead's data (name, email, phone number, property preferences) is automatically ingested into the system. The AI model analyzes the lead's data, assigns an initial score, and updates the lead's record in the CRM. As the lead interacts with the website (views properties, saves searches, requests showings), their score dynamically adjusts based on their behavior. If the lead's score crosses a predefined threshold, the agent receives a notification in their CRM, prompting them to follow up with the lead. The agent reviews the lead's profile in the CRM, assesses their behavior and score, and initiates contact via phone or email."

        "Machine Learning Model: A classification model (e.g., logistic regression, gradient boosting) predicts the probability of lead conversion based on historical lead data and behavioral signals.",
