      "name": "AI-Powered Predictive Maintenance",
      "overview": "This service provides predictive maintenance capabilities for material handling equipment by leveraging real-time sensor data and machine learning algorithms. It aims to minimize unexpected downtime, reduce maintenance costs, and extend the lifespan of critical equipment. The system continuously monitors equipment performance through various sensors, analyzes the data for anomalies and patterns indicative of potential failures, and generates proactive maintenance recommendations. This allows maintenance teams to schedule repairs and replacements during planned shutdowns, avoiding costly emergency repairs and production interruptions. The service integrates seamlessly with existing maintenance management systems and provides actionable insights through a user-friendly dashboard.",

      "user_journeys": [
        "A maintenance manager logs into the predictive maintenance dashboard. They review the overall equipment health status, identifying a conveyor belt system flagged as 'at-risk' due to unusual vibration patterns. The system predicts a bearing failure within two weeks with 85% confidence. The manager schedules a maintenance task to replace the bearings during the next planned shutdown, avoiding an unscheduled production halt."
