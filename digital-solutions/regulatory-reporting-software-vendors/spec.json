      "overview": "The AI-Powered Regulatory Change Forecaster is a proactive compliance solution designed to predict upcoming regulatory changes and assess their potential impact on financial institutions. This service leverages advanced machine learning techniques to analyze a wide range of data sources, including regulatory body publications, policy discussions, and legal precedents. By identifying patterns and trends, the forecaster provides actionable insights, enabling organizations to adapt their processes and systems in advance of regulatory shifts. This proactive approach minimizes the risk of non-compliance, reduces associated costs, and optimizes resource allocation for regulatory adaptation, allowing financial institutions to stay ahead of the curve and maintain a robust compliance posture.",
