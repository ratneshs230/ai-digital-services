      "name": "Predictive Quality Control System",
      "overview": "The Predictive Quality Control System is an AI-powered solution designed to predict quality defects in real-time during the automotive manufacturing process. By analyzing historical production data, sensor readings from manufacturing equipment, and visual inspection data, the system identifies potential defects before they occur, allowing for proactive intervention. This reduces material waste, improves overall product quality, and optimizes the manufacturing workflow. The system provides a user-friendly interface for quality control managers, production engineers, and plant managers to monitor defect predictions, investigate root causes, and implement corrective actions. The system will be deployed on the shop floor, integrating with existing manufacturing execution systems (MES) and programmable logic controllers (PLCs) to provide real-time feedback and control. The long-term objective is to move from reactive to proactive quality control, significantly reducing the cost of quality and improving operational efficiency.",

      "core_features": [
        "Real-time Defect Prediction: Machine learning models analyze sensor data, process parameters, and visual inspection data to predict potential defects in real-time, displayed on a dashboard with severity scores and potential impact.",
        "Alerting and Notifications: Automated alerts and notifications are triggered when a defect is predicted, notifying relevant personnel (e.g., production engineers, quality control managers) via email, SMS, or integration with existing MES systems. Alerts are configurable based on severity and location.",
        "Root Cause Analysis: The system provides tools for investigating the root causes of predicted defects, including data visualization, correlation analysis, and drill-down capabilities to identify contributing factors.  Includes automated suggestions for potential causes based on historical data.",
        "Process Parameter Optimization: The system recommends adjustments to process parameters (e.g., welding voltage, paint flow rate) to prevent predicted defects, based on the models' learned relationships. Provides A/B testing framework for validating recommendations.",
        "Historical Data Analysis: Comprehensive historical data analysis capabilities to identify trends, patterns, and correlations related to defects.  Includes customizable reporting and data export functionality for offline analysis.",

      ],
      "user_journeys": [
        "A quality control manager logs into the system dashboard, views real-time defect predictions for the welding process, sees a high-severity prediction for a potential weld defect on a car chassis, receives an automated alert, drills down into the data to identify the contributing factors (e.g., inconsistent welding voltage), notifies a production engineer, who adjusts the welding parameters, and the system confirms that the defect prediction has been mitigated."
      ],
      "ai_capabilities": [
        "The system utilizes machine learning models trained on historical production data (e.g., sensor readings from welding machines, paint booths), visual inspection data (images of parts), and process parameters (e.g., welding voltage, paint flow rate).",
        "Specifically, uses a combination of Random Forest, XGBoost, and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Random Forest and XGBoost are used for tabular sensor data and process parameters to predict defects. CNNs are used to analyze images from visual inspection systems to detect surface defects. Models are regularly retrained using new data to improve accuracy.",
        "Consider using OpenAI's GPT models for anomaly detection in text-based process logs. Embeddings will be used to vectorize unstructured data. Vector search (Pinecone/Supabase vectors) will be used to find similar past defect scenarios and potential solutions.  Fine-tuning will be considered if labeled defect data is plentiful and specific to the manufacturing process."
