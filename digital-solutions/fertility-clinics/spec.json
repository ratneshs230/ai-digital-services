      "name": "AI-Powered Embryo Grading System",
      "overview": "This service provides an automated embryo quality assessment tool using advanced computer vision techniques. It addresses the inherent subjectivity and variability in manual embryo grading, which often leads to inconsistencies in IVF success rates. The system analyzes microscope images of embryos, predicting their implantation potential with higher accuracy than traditional human grading methods. By leveraging a vast, pre-trained dataset of embryo images, the AI algorithm identifies subtle morphological features that correlate with successful implantation. The system integrates seamlessly into existing IVF lab workflows, allowing embryologists to upload images and receive instant viability rankings. This allows embryologists to prioritize the selection of embryos with the highest potential for transfer, optimizing IVF outcomes and reducing overall lab costs. The system aims to standardize and enhance the embryo selection process, improving patient satisfaction and increasing the efficiency of IVF clinics.",

        "An embryologist logs into the system using secure credentials. They upload microscope images of embryos obtained during an IVF cycle. The AI algorithm analyzes the images and generates a viability score for each embryo. The system ranks the embryos from highest to lowest potential for implantation, highlighting key morphological features. The embryologist reviews the AI-generated rankings and uses the data to inform their embryo selection decisions, prioritizing the transfer of embryos with the highest predicted viability. The embryologist documents the selection process and transfers the chosen embryo(s) to the patient. The system generates a report summarizing the grading results and embryo selection rationale, which is stored securely within the patient's record."
