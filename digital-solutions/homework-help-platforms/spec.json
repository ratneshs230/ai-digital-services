        "Adaptive Learning Paths – AI algorithms analyze student performance and dynamically adjust the difficulty and content of the learning path to match their skill level.",
        "Personalized Content Delivery – Explanations, examples, and practice problems are tailored to the student's learning style and knowledge gaps, ensuring optimal comprehension.",
        "Real-Time Feedback and Guidance – Students receive immediate feedback on their answers and detailed explanations of the correct solutions, promoting continuous learning and improvement.",
        "Progress Tracking and Reporting – Students and parents can track progress over time, identify areas of strength and weakness, and monitor overall learning outcomes.",
        "Gamified Learning Experience – Integration of game mechanics like points, badges, and leaderboards to increase student motivation and engagement."

      "user_journeys": [
        "A student logs in to the platform, selects a subject (e.g., Algebra), and starts a diagnostic assessment. The AI algorithm analyzes their performance on the assessment and identifies areas where they need help (e.g., factoring quadratic equations). The platform then generates a personalized learning path with targeted practice problems and explanations on factoring. As the student works through the problems, the AI monitors their progress and adjusts the difficulty level and content based on their performance. The student receives immediate feedback on their answers and can access detailed explanations of the correct solutions. The student completes the factoring module and progresses to the next topic, with the AI continuously adapting the learning path to their individual needs."

      "ai_capabilities": [
        "Knowledge Tracing: Utilizes a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) model to track student knowledge and predict future performance based on their interactions with the platform. This model will be fine-tuned using historical student performance data to improve accuracy.",
        "Content Personalization: Employs Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to analyze the learning content and identify key concepts and relationships. This allows the platform to generate personalized explanations and examples that are tailored to the student's learning style.",
        "Difficulty Adjustment: Uses a reinforcement learning algorithm (e.g., Q-learning) to dynamically adjust the difficulty of the practice problems based on the student's performance. This ensures that the student is challenged appropriately without becoming overwhelmed.",
        "Sentiment Analysis: Integrates sentiment analysis to detect frustration or confusion based on student's written responses in free-form questions and provide targeted assistance."
