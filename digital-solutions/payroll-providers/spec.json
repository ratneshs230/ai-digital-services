      "ai_capabilities": [
        "Anomaly Detection: Utilizes machine learning algorithms to detect unusual patterns and outliers in payroll data, such as spikes in overtime hours or unexpected wage increases. Models should be trained on historical payroll data to establish a baseline of normal behavior.",
        "Compliance Monitoring: Leverages natural language processing (NLP) to extract and interpret relevant information from labor laws and regulations. This information is then used to create rules and alerts that automatically monitor payroll data for compliance violations. Regular updates and fine-tuning are necessary to keep the system up-to-date with the latest regulatory changes.",
        "Error Prediction: Employs predictive modeling techniques to forecast potential payroll errors based on historical data and current trends. This allows payroll managers to proactively address issues before they occur.",
        "Model Selection: Consider using pre-trained models for NLP tasks, such as legal text analysis. For anomaly detection, explore unsupervised learning algorithms such as isolation forests or one-class SVMs. Fine-tuning may be required to optimize performance for specific payroll data and regulatory requirements.",
        "Embeddings and Vector Search: Utilize embeddings to represent employee profiles and payroll data points as vectors, allowing for efficient similarity searches and anomaly detection based on contextual relationships."
