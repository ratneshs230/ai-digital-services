      "name": "AI-Powered Driver Risk Score",
      "overview": "This service provides a continuously updated risk score for drivers based on telematics data and advanced AI modeling. It addresses the problem of inaccurate risk assessment in the insurance and fleet management industries, leading to higher premiums and increased accident frequency. By analyzing granular driving behavior, environmental factors, and historical data, the system generates a real-time risk profile, enabling proactive interventions and improved safety outcomes. The service integrates seamlessly with existing telematics systems, CRM platforms, and insurance underwriting workflows. The core objective is to reduce accident rates, lower insurance costs through precise risk pricing, and enhance overall driver safety through targeted training and personalized feedback. The solution leverages machine learning to adapt to individual driving patterns and evolving environmental conditions, offering a dynamic and accurate representation of driver risk.",

        "Real-time Risk Scoring: Continuously calculates a risk score for each driver based on telematics data (speed, braking, acceleration, location, time of day) and external factors (weather, traffic).",
        "Predictive Accident Modeling: Utilizes machine learning models to predict the likelihood of accidents based on historical data and current driving behavior.",
        "Personalized Driver Feedback: Provides drivers with personalized feedback and recommendations to improve their driving habits and reduce their risk score.",
        "Automated Alerting: Generates alerts for fleet managers and insurance underwriters when a driver's risk score exceeds a predefined threshold.",
        "Risk Trend Analysis: Identifies trends in driver risk over time, allowing for proactive intervention and preventative measures.",

      "user_journeys": [
        "A fleet manager logs into the system, views a dashboard displaying the risk scores of all drivers. They identify a driver with a consistently high-risk score. The manager drills down to see detailed driving behavior data, identifying instances of speeding and hard braking. The manager then assigns targeted training modules to the driver via the platform, and monitors their risk score over time to assess the effectiveness of the training."

        "Model Selection: Start with XGBoost or Random Forest for tabular data; consider Neural Networks for handling more complex patterns. Fine-tune models with driver-specific data to improve accuracy. Vector search is not directly applicable here, but embeddings could be used to represent driving styles for clustering and personalization."
