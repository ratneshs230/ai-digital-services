      "name": "AI-Powered Anomaly Detection for Medical Imaging",
      "overview": "This service provides an AI-powered anomaly detection system designed to automatically identify and flag potential anomalies in medical images. The system analyzes images from various modalities such as X-rays, CT scans, and MRIs, highlighting regions of interest for radiologists. By pre-screening images and prioritizing cases with detected anomalies, the system aims to reduce human error, improve diagnostic accuracy, and expedite the review process. This leads to faster turnaround times for patients, reduced liability for healthcare providers, and ultimately, increased patient satisfaction. The system is designed to integrate seamlessly into existing radiology workflows and PACS systems, providing radiologists with a powerful tool to enhance their diagnostic capabilities.",

        "Automated Anomaly Detection – Utilizes deep learning models to analyze medical images and automatically detect potential anomalies, such as lung nodules, fractures, or signs of stroke.",
        "Region of Interest (ROI) Highlighting – Highlights specific regions of interest within the images, drawing the radiologist's attention to areas that require closer examination.  The ROIs should be clearly delineated with adjustable confidence levels.",
        "Image Modality Support – Supports a wide range of image modalities, including X-rays, CT scans, MRIs, mammograms, and ultrasounds.",
        "Integration with PACS and RIS – Integrates seamlessly with existing Picture Archiving and Communication Systems (PACS) and Radiology Information Systems (RIS) for efficient workflow integration.  Integration should support HL7 standards.",
        "Customizable Sensitivity Settings – Allows radiologists to adjust the sensitivity of the anomaly detection algorithm to match their preferences and the specific clinical context.  This includes adjusting thresholds for anomaly scores.",

      "user_journeys": [
        "A radiologist logs into the PACS system. The system automatically retrieves new medical images. The AI-powered anomaly detection system analyzes each image in the background. If anomalies are detected, the system highlights the regions of interest and flags the image as high priority in the radiologist's worklist. The radiologist reviews the flagged images, focusing on the highlighted regions. The radiologist makes a final diagnosis based on the AI's findings and their own expertise. The radiologist documents the findings and diagnosis in the RIS. The system tracks the radiologist's interaction with the AI findings for performance monitoring."
