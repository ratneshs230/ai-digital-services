      "overview": "Impact Forecaster AI is a predictive analytics platform designed to optimize resource allocation in international development projects. It leverages machine learning models trained on historical project data, socio-economic indicators, and environmental factors to forecast the potential impact of new projects. This enables organizations to make data-driven decisions, improve project selection, increase ROI on development spending, and attract more funding by providing clear, evidence-based impact projections. The platform provides a user-friendly interface for inputting project parameters, visualizing predicted outcomes, and comparing different project scenarios. The core goal is to transition from gut-feeling based decisions to quantifiable projections using advanced analytics and modeling.",

      "user_journeys": [
        "A project manager logs into the Impact Forecaster AI platform. They input the details of a proposed irrigation project, including the location, budget, target population, and planned activities. The AI model analyzes this data in conjunction with historical data on similar projects, local soil conditions, rainfall patterns, and farmer training programs. The platform generates a forecast predicting the increase in crop yield and the improvement in farmer incomes over the next five years. The project manager uses this information to refine the project design, allocate resources more effectively, and develop a compelling funding proposal."

        "Model Selection Notes: Consider using OpenAI's GPT models for feature engineering and data augmentation, especially when dealing with unstructured data. Utilize embeddings to represent project characteristics and socio-economic indicators in a high-dimensional space for similarity analysis and clustering. Employ vector search (e.g., Pinecone, Supabase vectors) to quickly identify similar projects and access relevant historical data. Fine-tune pre-trained models on development-specific datasets to improve accuracy and relevance."
