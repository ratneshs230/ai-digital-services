      "name": "Predictive Maintenance Advisor",
      "overview": "The Predictive Maintenance Advisor is an AI-powered service designed to minimize unscheduled vehicle downtime and optimize fleet maintenance operations. By leveraging machine learning, the system analyzes real-time vehicle sensor data, historical maintenance records, and external environmental factors to predict potential component failures before they occur. This allows fleet managers and maintenance technicians to proactively schedule maintenance, reducing downtime, lowering costs associated with emergency repairs, and extending the overall lifespan of their vehicle fleet. The service provides actionable insights and recommendations, empowering users to make data-driven decisions regarding vehicle maintenance and resource allocation, ultimately improving operational efficiency and profitability.",
      "problems_addressed": [
        "High costs associated with unscheduled vehicle downtime.",
        "Inefficient maintenance scheduling leading to reactive repairs instead of proactive prevention.",

        "Real-time Vehicle Monitoring: Continuous monitoring of vehicle sensor data (e.g., engine temperature, oil pressure, brake performance, tire pressure) to detect anomalies and potential issues.",
        "Predictive Failure Analysis: Machine learning models predict potential component failures based on sensor data, historical maintenance records, and external factors.",
        "Maintenance Recommendation Engine: Generates proactive maintenance recommendations based on predicted failures, including specific tasks and suggested timelines.",
        "Maintenance Scheduling Optimization: Integrates with existing maintenance scheduling systems to automatically schedule maintenance tasks based on predictive insights.",

      "user_journeys": [
        "A fleet manager logs into the Predictive Maintenance Advisor dashboard. They observe an alert indicating a high probability of brake failure in a delivery truck based on recent driving patterns (frequent hard braking) and sensor data. The system recommends scheduling a brake inspection and replacement within the next week. The fleet manager schedules the maintenance through the integrated system, preventing a potential breakdown and ensuring timely delivery of goods."

      "ai_capabilities": [
        "Machine Learning for Predictive Maintenance: Regression and classification models are used to predict the remaining useful life (RUL) of vehicle components. Algorithms like Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Neural Networks are suitable for this task.",
        "Time Series Analysis: Time series models (e.g., ARIMA, LSTM) analyze sensor data over time to identify trends and anomalies that indicate potential component degradation or failure.",
        "Anomaly Detection: Unsupervised learning techniques (e.g., Isolation Forest, One-Class SVM) detect unusual patterns in sensor data that deviate from normal operating conditions.",
        "Model Selection: Start with simpler models like Random Forest or Gradient Boosting for initial baselines. Explore Neural Networks (LSTMs specifically) for time-series sensor data. Consider using pre-trained models for specific components if available. Vectorize all vehicle data and maintenance records for use in model training and prediction. Utilize embeddings to capture complex relationships between vehicle components, usage patterns, and failure modes.",
        "OpenAI models are not directly applicable for core predictive maintenance modeling but could enhance features like maintenance report summarization or natural language query interfaces. Fine-tuning might be needed for domain-specific language."
