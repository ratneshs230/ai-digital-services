      "name": "Outbreak Prediction AI",
      "overview": "The Outbreak Prediction AI is a proactive solution designed to forecast potential disease outbreaks by leveraging a diverse range of data streams. This service addresses the critical issue of delayed response to outbreaks caused by slow data analysis and reporting. By integrating data from sources such as social media, news articles, search engine queries, climate data, and historical disease patterns, the AI model identifies early warning signs and provides timely predictions. This enables epidemiologists, public health officials, and health policymakers to implement proactive interventions, reduce disease spread, lower healthcare costs, and improve public trust. The system is designed for real-time monitoring and analysis, delivering actionable insights to mitigate the impact of potential outbreaks before they escalate.",

      "user_journeys": [
        "A public health official logs into the Outbreak Prediction AI dashboard. They select a specific geographic region and time frame. The system displays a risk assessment map indicating potential outbreak hotspots based on integrated data. The official drills down into a high-risk area, reviewing the contributing factors (e.g., increased flu-related search queries, recent heavy rainfall, and historical data). Based on the AI's prediction, they initiate a targeted vaccination campaign and public awareness program in the identified area, monitoring the system's updated predictions to assess the campaign's impact."

Utilize embeddings and vector search (Pinecone) for efficient retrieval of similar past outbreak patterns. For time series forecasting, evaluate ARIMA and Prophet based on the characteristics of historical disease data.  For climate data, consider integration with existing meteorological models using API calls.  OpenAI models can be used for sentiment analysis and summarization of news and social media data."
