      "name": "AI-Powered SMS Copy Generator",
      "overview": "The AI-Powered SMS Copy Generator is a SaaS platform designed to automate and optimize the creation of SMS marketing messages. It leverages advanced natural language processing (NLP) models to generate high-converting SMS copy tailored to specific audience segments and campaign objectives. By analyzing user-provided inputs such as target audience demographics, interests, and desired campaign outcomes, the AI engine generates multiple message variations with diverse tones, calls to action, and promotional strategies. This eliminates the need for manual copywriting, drastically reduces campaign creation time, and significantly improves conversion rates for SMS marketers. The platform integrates seamlessly with existing SMS marketing platforms and provides comprehensive analytics to track the performance of AI-generated copy.",
      "problems_addressed": [
        "Time-consuming manual SMS copywriting process",
        "Low conversion rates due to ineffective SMS messaging",
        "Difficulty in tailoring SMS copy to diverse target audiences",

      "core_features": [
        "AI-Powered Copy Generation – Uses a fine-tuned NLP model to generate multiple SMS message variations based on user inputs.",
        "Audience Targeting – Allows users to define target audience demographics (age, location, interests), enabling the AI to tailor messages effectively.",
        "Campaign Goal Definition – Enables users to specify the desired outcome of the campaign (e.g., promote a sale, drive website traffic), guiding the AI's copy generation.",
        "A/B Testing – Facilitates A/B testing of different AI-generated message variations to identify the highest-performing copy.",
        "Performance Analytics – Provides detailed analytics on the click-through rates, conversion rates, and ROI of AI-generated SMS campaigns."

      "user_journeys": [
        "A marketer logs into the platform, enters target audience details (age: 25-35, location: New York, interests: fashion), selects the campaign goal ('Promote 20% off summer sale'), and clicks 'Generate'. The AI generates 5 SMS message variations. The marketer selects the top 2 variations, initiates an A/B test, and monitors performance analytics within the platform."

      "ai_capabilities": [
        "The core AI capability is a fine-tuned GPT-3.5 model specifically trained on a dataset of high-converting SMS marketing messages. This model takes as input the target audience demographics, campaign goals, and brand voice guidelines. It outputs multiple SMS message variations optimized for click-through rates and conversions.",
        "Model selection: Using GPT-3.5 Turbo provides a balance of cost and performance. Fine-tuning is essential to specialize the model for SMS marketing best practices and brand-specific tone. A vector database (Pinecone or Supabase Vectors) will store embeddings of successful SMS campaigns for semantic similarity search during copy generation."
