# AI-Powered Patient Triage & Routing

## Hospitals and health systems

Intelligent system that analyzes patient symptoms and medical history to route them to the most appropriate care setting (e.g., ER, urgent care, telehealth).

## Problem Solved

Reduces ER overcrowding, improves patient wait times, and ensures patients receive the right level of care.

## Core Solution

An AI model trained on medical data analyzes patient-reported symptoms and medical history to predict the optimal care setting and provide routing recommendations.

## Target Users

Hospitals, health systems, urgent care centers, patients.

## Business Impact

Reduces operational costs, improves patient satisfaction, and increases revenue through efficient resource allocation.

## Example Use Case

A patient experiencing chest pain uses a mobile app to describe their symptoms. The AI determines the severity and routes the patient to the nearest appropriate facility – either the ER or an urgent care based on risk factors.


## Features

- Symptom Checker: AI-powered symptom assessment tool that allows patients to input their symptoms and receive a preliminary assessment of their condition.
- Medical History Integration: Seamlessly integrates with existing Electronic Health Record (EHR) systems to access patient medical history for a more accurate assessment.
- Care Setting Recommendation: Based on the symptom analysis and medical history, the AI recommends the most appropriate care setting (ER, urgent care, telehealth, primary care).
- Facility Locator: Provides a list of nearby healthcare facilities based on the recommended care setting, including real-time wait times and directions.
- Telehealth Integration: Enables direct connection to telehealth providers for virtual consultations.
- Real-time Monitoring Dashboard: Offers a dashboard for healthcare providers to monitor patient flow and resource allocation.
- Risk Stratification: Classifies patients based on risk level (high, medium, low) to prioritize critical cases.
- Automated Notifications: Sends automated notifications to patients and healthcare providers regarding triage results and recommended next steps.

## AI Capabilities

- Natural Language Processing (NLP) for understanding patient-reported symptoms.
- Machine Learning (ML) for predicting the optimal care setting based on symptoms, medical history, and risk factors.
- Predictive modeling for anticipating patient flow and resource needs.
- Risk stratification models for prioritizing critical cases.

## Technical Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js 14 App Router, TypeScript, TailwindCSS, shadcn/ui, Vercel conventions for performance and scalability
- **Backend**: Node.js / Next.js server actions / Vercel serverless functions, REST API with Express.js or Next.js API routes
- **Database**: Planetscale / Supabase / PostgreSQL with JSONB support for flexible data storage and GEOGRAPHY type for location-based queries.
- **AI**: OpenAI API for NLP tasks, embeddings for semantic similarity, Pinecone or Supabase vectors for vector search.

## API Endpoints
